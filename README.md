This website is an experiment with a lot of different API's, techniques and other stuff. In other words - a pet project to learn Drupal a bit deeper.

It was inspired by many other documentation sites and their content editing process, but most important inspiration comes from ArchWiki. This project is trying to achieve the same things, but about Drupal and on Drupal, because, why not?
